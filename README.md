Importing Libraries:
We begin by importing essential libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, OpenCV, and others. These libraries provide us with the necessary tools for image processing, neural network operations, and file handling.
Loading Precomputed Features:
We load the precomputed feature vectors and filenames from previously stored pickle files. These features represent the fashion items in our dataset.
Model Initialization:
We initialize the ResNet50 model, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. By setting include_top=False, we remove the final classification layer, allowing us to use the model as a feature extractor. We then add a GlobalMaxPooling2D layer to reduce the dimensionality of the feature maps.
Feature Extraction for a Sample Image:
We load a sample image, preprocess it, and extract its feature vector using the ResNet50 model. This feature vector will be used to find similar images in our dataset.
Finding Nearest Neighbors:
We use the Nearest Neighbors algorithm to find the top 5 images in our dataset that are most similar to the sample image. The NearestNeighbors model is trained on our feature list, and then we find the closest matches to the sample image.
Displaying Similar Images:
We display the top 5 similar images using OpenCV. Each image is loaded, resized, and displayed to the user, allowing them to see the recommended fashion items.
Streamlit Interface:
We use Streamlit to create a simple and interactive web interface. The st.title function sets the title of our web app.
File Upload Handling:
We define a function save_uploaded_file to handle file uploads and save the uploaded file to the 'uploads' directory.
Feature Extraction Function:
We define a function feature_extraction that takes an image path and the model as inputs. This function processes the image, feeds it into the model, and returns a normalized feature vector.
Recommendation Function:
We define a function recommend that uses the Nearest Neighbors algorithm to find the top 5 images in our dataset that are most similar to the extracted features of the uploaded image.
Main Application Logic:
The main logic of our application handles the file upload, displays the uploaded image, extracts its features, finds the nearest neighbors, and displays the recommended images in a row using Streamlit columns.

In this project, we used two main algorithms:

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with ResNet50:

We utilized the ResNet50 model, a deep convolutional neural network pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, to extract features from the images. This model processes the images and outputs feature vectors that represent the high-level features of the images.
Nearest Neighbors Algorithm:

Specifically, we used the Nearest Neighbors algorithm from the scikit-learn library with the brute force search method and the euclidean distance metric. This algorithm helps in finding the top k nearest neighbors (most similar images) based on the feature vectors extracted by the ResNet50 model.
